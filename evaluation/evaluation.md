# Evaluation
## Comparison against objectives
| Objective number | Objective description | Evaluation |
|-----------------:|----------------------:|-----------:|
| 1 | The program should be able to accept the input equation after a prompt for user input | This objective has been met. There is a prompt for user input, and the equation can be input successfully. |
| 2ia | The program should support the add operation denoted by + | This objective was tested in test 2. It has been met. |
| 2ib | The program should support the subtract operation denoted by - | This objective was tested in test 3. It has been met. |
| 2ic | The program should support the multiply operation denoted by * | This objective was tested in test 4. It has been met. |
| 2id | The program should support the divide operation denoted by / | This objective was tested in test 5. It has been met. |
| 2ii | The program should ignore left brackets and spaces | Left brackets were tested in test 2 and spaces in test 6. The objective has been met. |
| 2iii | The program should perform an operation every time a right bracket is reached | Right brackets were tested in test 2, and were shown to be recognised by the program in all further tests. The objective has been met. |
| 3 | The program should display the result of the evaluation as a real number | Test 7 showed that the program could output negative values. Test 8 showed that the program was able to output non-integer values. This means the program can output any real number, so the objective has been met. |

## Opportunities to expand on the work
- Functionality could be added for other operators with two inputs, such as exponentation (^)
- Functionality could be added for one-input operators, such as unary minus (~)
